# Sana Khuram | Frontend Developer & Designer

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m **Sana Khuram**, a frontend developer with a strong artistic background. My work combines **creativity, design, and code** to build interactive, responsive, and visually engaging web experiences.  

I have a **BFA in Miniature Painting** and a **Master’s in Interior Design**, which deeply informs my approach to UI/UX. Every interface I create is treated like a canvas—balancing color, layout, and flow to make digital experiences intuitive and captivating.  

This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and personal design style. Key highlights include:  
- **Interactive UI components** built with React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS  
- **Responsive, accessible, and performance-driven design**  
- **Custom animations and transitions** using Framer Motion  
- **Integration of artistic sensibilities** into frontend development, blending illustration and design with code  
- **Icons and SVGs sourced from IconFinder**, carefully chosen to fit the design aesthetic

All layouts, color palettes, and typography are self-chosen. The goal is to provide a unique, immersive experience that reflects both my technical skills and creative vision.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out via the contact section—I’m always excited to collaborate and bring creative ideas to life!”
