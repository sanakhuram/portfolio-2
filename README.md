Welcome to my portfolio! I’m **Sana Khuram**, a frontend developer with an artistic background. My work combines **creativity, design, and code** to build interactive, responsive, and visually engaging web experiences.

This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and personal design style. It is designed to be **focused, professional, and easy to navigate**, highlighting the work and experiences that best reflect my abilities.

## 🎨 My Color Philosophy

Colors tell stories. They evoke feelings, memories, and moods. In this portfolio, every hue has a purpose:

- **Earthy Green:** Growth, grounding, and connection with nature.
- **Sky Blue:** Openness, clarity, and endless curiosity.
- **Purple:** Creativity, introspection, and the mysterious depth of ideas.
- **Feminist Pink:** Passion, empowerment, and warmth.
- **Gray:** Balance, neutrality, and quiet reflection.
- **Charcoal:** Strength, depth, and subtle seriousness.
- **Hints of Memory & Emptiness:** Soft accents that evoke nostalgia and thoughtfulness.

I believe in **color-graphy**—using colors as a narrative tool, not just decoration. This portfolio is my story, told through code, design, and a palette that feels _me_.

_The design and functionality are inspired by modern frontend practices and the work of developers I admire, while maintaining my unique artistic touch._
